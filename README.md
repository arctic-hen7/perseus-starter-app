# Perseus Starter App

*Note: this project only applies to Perseus v0.1.0, and is rendered irrelevant by the latest release of v0.2.0, the corresponding tutorial for which you can see [here](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/0.2.x/hello-world.html).*

This repository contains an example of each stage of the tutorial in the Perseus documentation on how to build your first app with the framework, which you can find [here](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/tutorials/first_app/intro.html).

You can step through the commit history of this repository to see each stage of the tutorial being completed, and this repository can act as a guide on how everything should end up looking.
